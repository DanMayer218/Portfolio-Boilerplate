         <p>  I am a currently seeking to transition industries after 14 years as a Landscape designer and contractor in New York City.  I have completed Columbia University's Engineering Coding Bootcamp which teaches fullstack development languages and practices and am eager to work.  I am currently working for Jonathan Kadish who is building the official archived website of the artist Philip Guston.  I am cataloging and preparing his work for the website and Jonathan Kadish is mentoring me as he is a Senior Fullstack developer.   </p>
           <p>a  Though I am new to the industry I come with a great talents, skills and real world experience that make me a valuable asset to any employer.  I am a former business owner with great project management and leadership capabilities.  I am a great communicator who worked closely and developed lasting relationships with my clients.  I was responsible for every aspect of the company.  I managed clients, employees, sales, installations and administrative duties.   </p>
           <p>
            Another asset I bring with me is my hyper creativity and resolute approach to problem solving.  I am a proven designer and have created exclusive gardens for an elite clientele exclusively in Manhattan.  Designing for such a discerning clientele, I had to consistently provide solutions to best suit the clients needs.  Installing gardens always provided obstacles that required my perspective and direction to resolve.  I also have great common sense, which I find is not always so common but allows me to approach every situation clearly and objectively.  It keeps me productive and positive in pressurized situations and benefits everyone I work with and for.  Its been my experience that my natural talents as an artist, musician and writer benefit everything I do professionally and personally.  I am a quick learner and being hyper creative I take initiative to learn and better myself constantly.  
           </p>
           <p>
            My wife and I own a home in Woodlawn(Bronx) and have two wonderful children.  My 14 year old daughter goes to Thornton Donovan on a scholarship and is on Honor Roll.  She was recently accepted to LaGuardia High School for music, art and the performing arts as an art major.  My son is 13 months old, has beautiful curls and has a smile that can light a room.  My wife is the most amazing person I have ever met and is my counterpart and often my better half all of the way.  Some of her accolades include graduating top of her class from Sarah Laurence, getting masters degrees from there and NYU at the same time while working for Quadrant Capital Advisors and being the wonderful Mother and Wife that I have always known.  I've always felt very blessed for the life and abilities that I have always had.   I am a very positive person and it is paramount to me to do great and meaningful work.
